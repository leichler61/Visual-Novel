## Nonfunctional Specifications:

__Usability:__ 
- The Settings menu of the game should provide a short explanation of the mechanics of the game and the objective if the player becomes confused at any point.
- The minigames will be clearly explained before they begin and will allow for multiple tries for the player to learn how to play. They will also serve as tutorials for the boss battle.
- The dialogue options will be clearly explained and easy to choose by just selecting a number on the keyboard.
- Text, visuals, and audio will be as clear as possible. We will try to make the game as easily accessible as possible.
- The Settings menu will allow the user to leave the game at any time. Ideally, we would have a mechanic to save and then load the game, but this may not be feasible with the size of our project already.

__Reliability:__ There should be no possible failures of the program. If it is written and implemented correctly, there will be no way for the player to do something in the game that we have not accounted for, as they will only be able to pick dialogue options and play the minigames. If there is game failure, we will return to the Settings menu with an error message. Ideally, the user would be able to load from a recent save game, but if we are not able to implement that, they would have to start the game from the beginning again.

__Performance:__ The game should run smoothly and efficiently, with as little lag as possible. This will maintain a positive gaming experience for the player and will not break their immersion in the game and the story.

__Supportability:__  The game must be able to support dialogue in the form of text, dialogue options for the player to pick, a jackpot minigame, visuals, audio, and timed events. The game is adaptable in terms of text, visuals, and audio, as we can make them more simplistic if we need to or even make them more complex. Additionally, it is adaptable in terms of script and dialogue, as we can modify and cut the script to make it shorter if necessary. 

__Implementation:__ Software must run on Android devices as a mobile application. Software must be written in Java.

__External interfaces:__ None

__Legal:__ Audio and visuals of the game, characters, and locations imagery do not violate copyright.
